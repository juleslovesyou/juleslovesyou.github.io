        <p>I think people these days eat a lot more than they need. What about coffee and alcohol? Think about all those cafes and bars that do shit coffees and musics but still pack of people? People drink and get drunk no matter what the quality is. I feel like they just want to spend some time in somewhere and drink whatever available. It&rsquo;s kinda like being hungry and choosing to eat anything, even poo—absurd.</p>
<p>When I see drunk people, it can’t look worse. They talk same thing over and over again then they don’t remember the next day about what they gibberish. Girls can’t control their body like their head is way heavy, almost look like their bodies say “I’m vulnerable right now please fuck me”.
It’s off the topic by the way, but I am aroused when a guy gets hard while he’s watching me crying, It&rsquo;s like a lion eyeing a deer with a broken leg—delicious and vulnerable. <em>smacking lips</em>
Some people are loud, some can be violent, most of them just look stupid, and maybe a few can piss the bed. Lack of self control is my least favourite to see when I observe human species.</p>
<p>Now when it comes to food, I can imagine the taste just by looking at a menu. I&rsquo;m too old to be taking food pics for Instagram with my face in every shot. And let&rsquo;s not forget the guilt of putting on weight—that&rsquo;s my biggest fear. Tasty dishes don&rsquo;t excite me; they make me uncomfortable. I already know what they taste like, and more calories? No thanks.</p>
<p>Skipping the drug talk since many of you already know that I’ve been admitted psych-ward a few times because of it (and I’m proud of myself that I’m clean for I don’t even know I lost count now), it’s just so much self destructive compare to its short moment of pleasure therefore guilty always follows together.</p>
<p>Back then when I started my sex career, until now actually I’ve been researching and contemplating the reason why sex work is still taboo and even illegal or treated as crime activity in some countries. I’ve never asked opinions to other service providers so it’s only personal but I think firstly it’s taboo because non-sexworkers, especially women never want their vagina power to be stolen. Many of women actually have controls over their men with their vaginal power since men are pretty simple. They are happy as long as they are fed and emptied their balls. If that’s not the case what else can it be? Don’t be silly and say, “because it spread STDs!”. I assume guys usually don’t mind, or maybe even like to talk about their experience with service providers. Some of them maybe feeling guilty because the feel like they have cheated on their wives and girlfriends. Most of them, I’m pretty sure though, not very opinionated as long as they cum.
What really else apart from the fact that non-sexworker don’t like it and their men pretend they don’t like it either because they are like pussy prayer weak simps? Maybe maybe maybe some governments and organisations try to save sex-workers from their guilt trips. Maybe we are meant to have sex with our loved ones only. The guilt trip about sucking many dicks is immense, and it almost hurts me every time these days. I thought sex work is just a kind of work, and I gotta enjoy it if I can’t avoid situation and mate, who’s gonna pay me $400 an hour if not horny men? But what if I CAN avoid the situation and I’m just lazy, saying “aww I only want to work 3-4 hours a week and get paid the same as what other people normally do.” I hate feeling guilty but I constantly do like I actually enjoy it. If I hate guilt trip this much, I can actually avoid it by not doing it. Right?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I lived like a Rome king last two weeks. They had so much food and drink so they ate and drank until felt sick and went puke-torium to throw all up using feather, came back ate again, had orgy… then got wasted lying down, slept, and did double penetration… not like that extreme but we dined out every night, drank heaps and tested my limit, had very very naughty sex that the Santa never include our names in his “NICE” list.
More than anything else, moment of connection were more than just euphoric. Holding hands on the dinner table and looking into each others eyes while talking frivolous things until the waitress brings the dishes, or crying and laughing until unknowingly falling a sleep on his tummy while enjoying head pats. (Oh my god this paragraph fucked me in 99 positions with confusing tense uses)</p>
<p>It’s so electrifying, priceless that I’m so worried now, Pleasure always seems to come with guilt, like those &ldquo;buy one, get one free&rdquo; deals at Korean convenience stores. Weird analogy, I know.</p>
