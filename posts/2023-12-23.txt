It seems that each person tries to overcome life-long boredom in their own way. I'm writing this while eating the “roasted capsicum, pecorino, cashew nuts and basil” dip.

First, we need to find out who the fuck first discovered the actual ingredients. It’s the curious one. They can’t just pass by things. Whenever I eat 고사리, or Rambutan, I can’t not think of why and how people started to eat those gross looking fern and hairy balls look-alike fruit. The first person who discovered capsicum,(it’s still understandable because capsicums looking cute. Green, yellow, red, it looks almost like they are xmas tree ornaments.) probably had it raw for a while then thought, fuck I can’t take it anymore it’s boring but only until they discovered fire. And when they finally got to have fire, probably, tried to cook it with different methods, then now the creative one comes, and says “hey don’t you think it’d be good if we eat this with some green, nuts, and cheese also?” But maybe cheese was invented waaaay later anyway the curious one can’t wait to try to mix things up because it intrigues the curious’ tastebuds. Mmmm...and they eat like this for a while until they got bored again and another curious and experimental one made cheese by accident or something so they try to make cheese out of other mammals breast milk which I think it’s crazy. (I’m no soygirl, either lactose intolerant by the way)

Life gets bored pretty quickly and easily especially when it’s work-related, food on the table, pays the bills etc. I recently noticed that I close my eyes while I’m sexing for living,(after Greg judged my performance by 1 out of 400, I was very cautious about what I’m doing.) I.. I do close my eyes. It’s not because I don’t like to see what’s going on, I, in fact, open my Asian small eyes wide while I’m kissing to see L’s eyeballs. We are so close so I only get to see his one eye but it’s rolling half backward, pupil becomes unfocused and dilated(maybe because we drank too), watching a person with the charisma to rule the world, who normally has nothing to be afraid of, become this weak and vulnerable with just a kiss is fascinating and sexy! I got to enjoy it. It’s more like because I am feeling awkward looking at customers eyes, similar to I can’t look people eyes directly(EYE CONTACT) when I’m lying. I’m shamed and sorrying because I’m acting(lying) that I’m enjoying it, and it gets so bored some times so I just close my eyes and think about something else like who the fuck invented tanghulululu etc

What do you do when you think your job is meaningless and boring, no motivational or inspirational in any ways? Also, I’m in love, 🧡UwU💚 I quit. So exciting! I’ll keep on posting here once or twice a week. Thanks for reading byee oh merry christmas!
