        <p>People tell me to write more but I don&rsquo;t have much things to offer. I in fact write a lot more than I post for example: forequater cutlet, but I know this is not what people expect from me. I used to write about my daddy issues, the relationship struggles and such but who wants to know someone&rsquo;s darkside when everyone has a problem or two day to day. I don&rsquo;t want to give the impression of whinging girlfriend or wife.</p>
<p>Today I realized that it&rsquo;s SuperDuper doable to save $100,000. It&rsquo;s only 250 customers. If I see 5 customers a day, it takes only 50 days. Will I ever be able to achieve this? No.</p>
<p>I want someone loves me so bad like van Gogh cut his ear for his favourite hooker. I want to be wanted. Being demanded feels so good and That is why maybe I am happy to see a customer a day. It feels much better when I get a lot of messages and choose one carefully than waiting 8 hours hoping that people to message me and eventually i get 5 or 6 customers, at max. Maybe this is why I am annoyed when I get &lsquo;are you available&rsquo; message because then I know, he has too much options. I even want to see some mild desperation and struggle, but not tooooo much because then you look like you have nothing to do.</p>
<p>Okay enough for today. if I write too much then you&rsquo;d probably lose interest in me, which I&rsquo;m scared of the most.
I got 3 breakouts near my mouth and that means I&rsquo;m pretty close to my monthly. More excuses for not working and making thirsty man gets thirstier!!!</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, oh this is the forequater cutlet:</p>
<p>Last night, I had a strong craving for pork ribs. It&rsquo;s unusual for me to crave a specific dish because, typically, I view food as a means to fill the hunger. This particular craving felt somewhat manic, especially since I&rsquo;ve rarely desired not only food but any, lately.</p>
<p>I hurried to Coles, but the butcher had already closed since it was close to closing time. I sadly gazed at the closed butchery showcase, longing for those ribs. I even told my dog that I would get pork ribs, and he could have some too. I felt disappointed at the thought of letting him down. With a heavy heart, I turned my attention to the pork section. I decided to grab a forequarter cutlet because it had bones and seemed to have a good distribution of fat. It was somewhat similar to pork ribs but in a flat, wide shape. I didn&rsquo;t even bother checking the package to see what part of the meat it was.</p>
<p>When I returned home and placed my purchases in the fridge, I noticed that I had bought an interesting tofu, which was in a jar (usually, it comes in a plastic square container). I had purchased it on a hot day and had carried it around for a few hours, so I was concerned it might go bad soon. I opened the jar and gave it a sniff, and it still seemed okay. It was tofu, but I couldn&rsquo;t help but wonder why it was in a jar. It looked almost like biji (Korean bean curd), the main ingredient for my favourite Korean dishes. At this point, I had forgotten my initial craving, and I also had some of my favourite kimchi, so I decided to attempt making kimchi biji stew with the ingredients I had.</p>
<p>The package of the forequarter cutlet mentioned that it was intended for BBQ and grilling, but I didn&rsquo;t care at this point. I decided to throw everything into the pot and hoped for the best. Rendering the fat and dealing with the bones proved to be a challenge, and after an hour of cooking,
it still tasted like a kimchi puddle where the pig had briefly dipped its feet. Nevertheless, I trusted in the power of pork bones and continued to simmer, hoping it would eventually transform into a thick, creamy, nutritious, and hearty base, reminiscent of Japanese donkotsu or Korean gamjatang. I simmered it for a total of 4 hours, and the soup indeed became thicker and milkier. Now, it tasted delicious.</p>
