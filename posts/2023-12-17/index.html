        <p>Last month, just before the holiday, there was a guy who came in a pharmacist costume. I opened the door, he entered, and he said he would leave because I am different from his expectation. But seriously, is your false fantasy my fault? I explained that I only book one customer a day, so he has to pay for wasting my time. Initially, he refused, but eventually, he paid $100. Hmm… I can only guess; perhaps he didn&rsquo;t want to engage because I was taller than him, and it was intimidating, or maybe I wasn&rsquo;t as attractive as he imagined. To be honest, I don&rsquo;t know. Door-dashes still upset me, and I wish him sixth-degree whole-body burns and a one-way ticket to hell.</p>
<p>My blog gets 50-60 visitors daily, and all of a sudden, it hit nearly 300 last week (or around 10 days ago; I forgot). I wasn&rsquo;t even in Sydney, Australia. Thanks to a guy named Greg and his devoted mention of my blog and appearance as &ldquo;she&rsquo;s your Asian girl-next-door, which you might walk by without noticing&rdquo;! Though I still feel uncomfortable being judged or criticized for my performance, I have to admit that his review was based on facts. The sex was boring and mundane. I said no to 69 (cos my elbows hurt uwu). Not gonna lie, that was so unprofessional of Jules. I give Greg&rsquo;s review (on me) a 1 out of 5 only because I don&rsquo;t like receiving a bad review, but I appreciate his honesty. If I were to write a review of anything, I would be like Greg. Such a great reviewer.</p>
<p>I unknowingly and jokingly mention &ldquo;broken family&rdquo; a lot. Whenever someone accuses me of anything, I half-jokingly say, &ldquo;cos I’m from a broken family uwu&rdquo; or &ldquo;my mum cheated on my dad, so I’m a degenerate&rdquo; or &ldquo;no father figure for 20 years, so go figure.&rdquo; During this visit, my mum brought it up that I overuse these and it hurts her. She even compared me to her current partner’s kids, questioning why I&rsquo;m a failure while they are well-grown, independent, responsible, delightful taxpayers, despite all of us being from broken families. She said she tried her best to raise me alone (with her uncountable ex-boyfriends&rsquo; mental support and my dad’s financial support), so it’s not fair for her if I&rsquo;m being degenerate and blaming my parents for it. I had a lot to say, but I kept quiet and said, &ldquo;yes, ma’am.&rdquo; I think I’m mature now, or maybe I&rsquo;m just too tired to fight her or partly agree with what she said. Like how I hate Greg’s review, but from Greg’s point of view, it&rsquo;s all a true story, and you know, I am sowwy!</p>
<p>This was the first trip that my mum and I did not argue, and I think we are both trying and improving. She said she’s proud of me for being only this much degenerate despite being born between an autistic dad and a neurotic herself.</p>
<p>Announcement: I&rsquo;m going overseas again from the 28th, so let’s sin before we get a year older. This year, I am already on the naughty list, BUT I&rsquo;ll be on the &ldquo;nice&rdquo; from next year, okay
Xmas: working
Xmas eve: working</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, bye.</p>
