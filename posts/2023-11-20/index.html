        <p>What I usually do is that I note random thoughts through the week and organise(write) on Sunday with a sprinkle of GPT&rsquo;s help. (I ask them to fix any grammatical errors) buuuut I had a blast last week so I can&rsquo;t be bothered anymore and didn&rsquo;t think much because I was busy at dinner date etc so there are two types of blogs today one is non-filtered(organic) one, and other I asked chat GPT to rewrite. I think those are two different stories but I find both of them fun to read.</p>
<h2 id="organic-version">Organic version:</h2>
<p>I think my previous blog was too techbros friendly and I ended up with seeing 100 percent techbros clients. I used to get more variations so I was thinking what makes it more fair to anyone&hellip; please solve the puzzle and contact me via that number. I changed simcard and I will again every month or so catch me if you can.</p>
<p>not that I like, or dislike techbros I just think that it&rsquo;s better sharing good things as many people in many background as I could like do you share meme to your friend. but I found some things that i don&rsquo;t like about techbros, its that &hellip; they have no ambitions about making things better. well I only met few techbros in real-life and had a chat with a lot of them so I can&rsquo;t generalise this easy but don&rsquo;t you think whole these process, booking escort/private sexworkers or even service providers in brothels and other shops should be easier than this? it&rsquo;s just so much outdated and ugly when the world is offering many more things. (I am comparing uber and airbnb with current escort directories, review, and listing sites) not complaining (maybe I am though) about existing systems since I can still pay my bills and feed my animal but if you can, with your skills and knowledge then why would you not think about it all? i guess techbros are comfy, they are too comfy.</p>
<p>Well maybe I&rsquo;m the comfiest one amongst any of you so who I&rsquo;m judging. you see ducks and geese in macquarie lake they are so content with what they have while I always think that they look so depressing living in stagnant water eating moss and food waste that human left over there. they could&rsquo;ve escaped from the lake, cross the dangerous talavera road and notorious m2 then they could&rsquo;ve reached the beautiful lane cove national park and one day maybe, who knows, swim through they could be in papua new guinea at one point. they just live comfortable now forget that they could swim harder or even they might be able to fly who knows, use wings! don&rsquo;t just wish the fortune that one day you see the beautiful lake in swiss just because water streams, like I live because I was born and think that breathing in and out is enough for me.</p>
<p>anyway&hellip; enough vent for today and again I only talk to a few techbros so I will try not to generalise. think I&rsquo;m more projecting myself through anyone I&rsquo;ve encountered.</p>

<p>Subject: Reflecting on Diversity and Innovation in Escort Services</p>
<p>Hi there,</p>
<p>After some reflection on my previous blog, I realized that it unintentionally attracted a predominantly tech-savvy audience. While I appreciate the support, I&rsquo;ve always valued diversity and connecting with people from various backgrounds. So, let&rsquo;s unravel the puzzle together and open up the conversation.</p>
<p>To reach me, drop a message at the provided number. Please note that I change my sim card regularly, adding a touch of spontaneity to our interactions.</p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s talk about something that has been on my mind. It&rsquo;s not about liking or disliking tech enthusiasts, but rather about sharing positive experiences with a broader audience. Just like sharing a meme with a friend, I believe in spreading good vibes to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>However, I&rsquo;ve noticed certain aspects about the tech community that don&rsquo;t align with my vision. Some tech enthusiasts seem to lack ambition when it comes to improving existing systems, especially in the realm of booking escort services. In a world full of innovation, why does the process still feel outdated and unappealing? Think about it – comparing the seamless experiences of Uber and Airbnb with the current state of escort directories and review platforms. I&rsquo;m not complaining, well maybe a little, since I can still manage my bills and take care of my pet. But, with your skills and knowledge, shouldn&rsquo;t we all be striving for something better?</p>
<p>Perhaps, some tech enthusiasts are too comfortable in their current situations. Comfort can be deceiving, and it&rsquo;s easy to overlook the potential for improvement. I may be one of the comfiest individuals among us, and who am I to judge? It&rsquo;s like observing ducks and geese in Macquarie Lake – seemingly content with their surroundings. But is their comfort preventing them from exploring beyond the lake, crossing barriers, and reaching new horizons?</p>
<p>I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to say is, let&rsquo;s not settle for stagnation. Just as the ducks and geese could venture beyond their familiar waters, we too can strive for more. It&rsquo;s about using our metaphorical wings, pushing boundaries, and embracing the unknown. Don&rsquo;t just wish for a beautiful lake in Switzerland; strive to create your own picturesque landscape.</p>
<p>Enough venting for today. Remember, these thoughts are based on my personal experiences, and I&rsquo;ll strive not to generalize. Looking forward to diverse and inspiring conversations.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>[Your Name]</p>
