It is unfortunate that E&B charges me the same amount of money as someone who advertises 7 days a week. It's not the most efficient platform for those who only work occasionally. I'd be wasting someone else's time, and I wouldn't gain anything by keeping my ad on 24/7, so I don't see the point. Anyway, it's only $20 a week, so no hard feelings! I've been searching for a new platform with innovative ideas for several years now but haven't had any luck.

I'm writing in a hurry before my profile goes down. It's easier to write when I have specific things in my head, but for the past few days, my headspace hasn't been very organized, and I blame it on hormones.

Being a woman is hard. From mowing armpits, legs, and private parts to maintaining clean nails, eyelashes, and a good smell... and what about that time of the month? The worst part isn't even the bleeding every month; that's only 5 days a month. The worst thing that can happen to a woman is the 2 weeks right before her actual period.

(*trigger warning: ‚ö†Ô∏è the following paragraph may sound like complaining girlfriend. Some people may find disturbing, so you can skip this part if you prefer.)

Physically, I felt like an ogre because:

- I have some breakouts around my lips and chin.
- I felt bloated; in other words, I looked fat. To add to that, I was constantly hungry and craving sugar, which was directly related to the inflammation (resulting in breakouts and chronic hip pain).
- Eczema flared up in random parts of my body for reasons I couldn't fathom. The immune department goes on strike or something
- I had migraines, insomnia, and a UTI...

Mentally:

- I struggled with body dysmorphia. I wanted to smash the mirror when I saw all those physical attributes I mentioned earlier. I couldn't help but hate myself even more.
- I felt hyperneurotic, sensitive, and judgmental due to overthinking. I think all my cardio consists of either sex or overthinking. You could find me in the body wash aisle at Coles, scratching my eczema-flared arm until it bled, while simultaneously thinking about guys, specifically the ones who spend their money on sex. I couldn't make a decision in front of so many choices. I was inundated with new products claiming to be newer and better. I don't think I can try them all before I die. I don't know if I feel excited or overwhelmed. Do people feel the same way when they see hundreds or thousands of service providers' profiles and advertisements? I wasn't convinced to buy any of them and decided to check out Sephora. While walking there, I noticed a lot of people wearing "essentials" jumpers and "white fox" hoodies. What's this trend about, and when will it stop? Why are people nowadays into bold logos, like some Ivy League university or sports team they never joined? I bought a t-shirt with the "Adelaide racket sports, the championship league" logo on it. It's ridiculously funny; I've never even been to Adelaide. Is it because humans are social beings and need to feel a sense of belonging? But you've never joined a random tennis club in California, in the US. What do people think when they buy a very basic-looking t-shirt with "essentials," "white fox," or "thisisneverthat¬Æ" on it? I'm genuinely curious. I couldn't find anything good at Sephora either, and at this point, I'm tired, so I just bought something that smells good from Aesop. I saw a woman wearing a pair of open-heel sandals, and her heels looked like the Millennium drought (1997-2009), one of the worst droughts in Australian history. I saw a random guy waiting for Lanzhou noodles, and I wondered if he occasionally saw working girls too. I saw a family enjoying lunch in the busy food court; they must have gone ice-skating. Then I wondered if I would have been happier if I had gotten married when everyone else did, bred one or two children, and taken a family trip once a year... like everyone else following the course of nature. Am I being jealous? Or just more concerned? Suddenly, I started thinking about my mistakes, failures, and uncertain future... and I sighed.

It's getting worse with age. I don't know whether it's nature's punishment for not breeding even though I'm fertile, or if I just recognize it better now than ever because it's been like this for ages. FYI, google "korea birth rate 2023" I find it hilarious.

Don't worry though; my cycle is pretty accurate, with a margin of error of +-2 days, and I'll forget everything I was anxious about as soon as I start to bleed. Don't forget to follow and hit the subscribe button on juleslovesyou.github.io üòÇ byeee
