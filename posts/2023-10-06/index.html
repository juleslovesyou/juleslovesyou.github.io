        <p>It is unfortunate that E&amp;B charges me the same amount of money as someone who advertises 7 days a week. It&rsquo;s not the most efficient platform for those who only work occasionally. I&rsquo;d be wasting someone else&rsquo;s time, and I wouldn&rsquo;t gain anything by keeping my ad on 24/7, so I don&rsquo;t see the point. Anyway, it&rsquo;s only $20 a week, so no hard feelings! I&rsquo;ve been searching for a new platform with innovative ideas for several years now but haven&rsquo;t had any luck.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing in a hurry before my profile goes down. It&rsquo;s easier to write when I have specific things in my head, but for the past few days, my headspace hasn&rsquo;t been very organized, and I blame it on hormones.</p>
<p>Being a woman is hard. From mowing armpits, legs, and private parts to maintaining clean nails, eyelashes, and a good smell&hellip; and what about that time of the month? The worst part isn&rsquo;t even the bleeding every month; that&rsquo;s only 5 days a month. The worst thing that can happen to a woman is the 2 weeks right before her actual period.</p>
<p>(*trigger warning: ‚ö†Ô∏è the following paragraph may sound like complaining girlfriend. Some people may find disturbing, so you can skip this part if you prefer.)</p>
<p>Physically, I felt like an ogre because:</p>
<ul>
<li>I have some breakouts around my lips and chin.</li>
<li>I felt bloated; in other words, I looked fat. To add to that, I was constantly hungry and craving sugar, which was directly related to the inflammation (resulting in breakouts and chronic hip pain).</li>
<li>Eczema flared up in random parts of my body for reasons I couldn&rsquo;t fathom. The immune department goes on strike or something</li>
<li>I had migraines, insomnia, and a UTI&hellip;</li>
</ul>
<p>Mentally:</p>
<ul>
<li>I struggled with body dysmorphia. I wanted to smash the mirror when I saw all those physical attributes I mentioned earlier. I couldn&rsquo;t help but hate myself even more.</li>
<li>I felt hyperneurotic, sensitive, and judgmental due to overthinking. I think all my cardio consists of either sex or overthinking.</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s getting worse with age. I don&rsquo;t know whether it&rsquo;s nature&rsquo;s punishment for not breeding even though I&rsquo;m fertile, or if I just recognize it better now than ever because it&rsquo;s been like this for ages. FYI, google &ldquo;Korea birth rate 2023&rdquo; I find it hilarious.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry though; my cycle is pretty accurate, with a margin of error of +-2 days, and I&rsquo;ll forget everything I was anxious about as soon as I start to bleed. Don&rsquo;t forget to follow and hit the subscribe button on juleslovesyou.github.io üòÇ byeee</p>
