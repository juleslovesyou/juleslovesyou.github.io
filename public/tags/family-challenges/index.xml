      <description>Last month, just before the holiday, there was a guy who came in a pharmacist costume. I opened the door, he entered, and he said he would leave because I am different from his expectation. But seriously, is your false fantasy my fault? I explained that I only book one customer a day, so he has to pay for wasting my time. Initially, he refused, but eventually, he paid $100. Hmmâ€¦ I can only guess; perhaps he didn&amp;rsquo;t want to engage because I was taller than him, and it was intimidating, or maybe I wasn&amp;rsquo;t as attractive as he imagined.</description>
