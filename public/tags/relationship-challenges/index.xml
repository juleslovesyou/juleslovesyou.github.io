      <title>Long-Distance Love Chronicles: Effort Trumps Distance</title>

      <description>I have failed long-distance relationship once and I blamed its distance.(It was only Melbourne-Sydney which is only about 900 km.) I want to touch, smell, and my hair get stroked, and my back be patted but I can’t, how inconvenient!
However, distance isn&amp;rsquo;t the culprit; effort is the key.
Facetime regularly after wakeup and before go to bed 2 hours each plus in between work, gym, dinner breaks sometimes. You may wonder what subjects we talk about, it’s so random, from freestyle ted-talk to love poet, from dirty-jokes that make my eyebrows go up to tearing up speech, unlimited possibilities.</description>
