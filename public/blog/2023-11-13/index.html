<content>
  <p>Come on, guys! My blog(<a href="https://juleslovesyou.github.io">https://juleslovesyou.github.io</a>) is up and running with no issues at all.</p>
<p>I charge the same amount of money for the rich and poor, old and young, healthy, unfit, ugly, sexy, crooked, autistic, Mensa member, Cenno beneficiary, etc. So, I don&rsquo;t know why many people tell me where they live, how attractive they are, and what they do for a living because have I asked ever</p>
<p>I think it&rsquo;s possibly because men assume that I choose a customer of the day based on their background and hygiene. But in modern days, there are only a few people who can still be dirty and smelly after showering at least once a day. Also, I have a clean bathroom with Aesop body cleanser, so don&rsquo;t worry about mentioning your hygiene status. But please do something if you have phimosis. I luckily have encountered it only once in my life, and it still haunts me sometimes. Horrendous!</p>
<p>If you can pay $400 for an hour just to spend time with a girl next door, I already think that you are in a pretty comfortable position. So, don&rsquo;t bother thinking that I&rsquo;ll judge you as poor. If you still want to prove your wealth, I have a tip jar on my kitchen top, so maybe you can fill that up with gold coins only.</p>
<p>Not that I don&rsquo;t like listening to your success stories; in fact, I quite enjoy it. But you can tell me when we rest after the business is done. I have several sperm donor candidate numbers saved in my phone based on their resumes and CVs. Handsome, fit, young, wealthy, and smart men! They not only intimate me with a humongous social gap but also make me feel uncomfortable. What do you want me to do? I&rsquo;m only a sex worker ðŸ˜­ do you want me to kneel down and kiss your feet when you enter my apartment?? Kek, I&rsquo;m only joking. You can send me whatever you want; it never bothers me but gives me an idea of writing, so all good. Remember, when inquiring about booking, please provide:</p>
<p>A copy of your ID that shows your name include surname:
Your status in society:
Linkdin profile link:
Annual income after-tax:
Vehicle you drive and its year:
Perfume you wear:
Watch(es):
Whether you can offer me a job opportunity: not the secretary that give you head while you&rsquo;re on business golf meeting
Relationship Status: remember that the majority of customers are not single, so don&rsquo;t ever feel guilty because without you guys ðŸ˜­ how can I pay my bills
Fitness club membership status:
Deadlift, how many KGs can you do:
Any things you can offer other than money: investment advice that I&rsquo;ll never listen carefully or teach me some skills, eg: how to fish or a staff discount?
You bald? yes/no/in progress/rather not to say</p>
<p>Today&rsquo;s post is only a joke okay, don&rsquo;t get butthurt. You know why I like Aesop so much? Because it&rsquo;s never overpowering, yet it lasts long so subtle. I want to be a human-being like that.</p>
