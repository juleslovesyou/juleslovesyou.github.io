  <p>It seems that each person tries to overcome life-long boredom in their own way. I&rsquo;m writing this while eating the ‚Äúroasted capsicum, pecorino, cashew nuts and basil‚Äù dip.</p>
<p>First, we need to find out who the fuck first discovered the actual ingredients. It‚Äôs the curious one. They can‚Äôt just pass by things. Whenever I eat Í≥†ÏÇ¨Î¶¨, or Rambutan, I can‚Äôt not think of why and how people started to eat those gross looking fern and hairy balls look-alike fruit. The first person who discovered capsicum,(it‚Äôs still understandable because capsicums looking cute. Green, yellow, red, it looks almost like they are xmas tree ornaments.) probably had it raw for a while then thought, fuck I can‚Äôt take it anymore it‚Äôs boring but only until they discovered fire. And when they finally got to have fire, probably, tried to cook it with different methods, then now the creative one comes, and says ‚Äúhey don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôd be good if we eat this with some green, nuts, and cheese also?‚Äù But maybe cheese was invented waaaay later anyway the curious one can‚Äôt wait to try to mix things up because it intrigues the curious‚Äô tastebuds. Mmmm&hellip;and they eat like this for a while until they got bored again and another curious and experimental one made cheese by accident or something so they try to make cheese out of other mammals breast milk which I think it‚Äôs crazy. (I‚Äôm no soygirl, either lactose intolerant by the way)</p>
<p>Life gets bored pretty quickly and easily especially when it‚Äôs work-related, food on the table, pays the bills etc. I recently noticed that I close my eyes while I‚Äôm sexing for living,(after Greg judged my performance by 1 out of 400, I was very cautious about what I‚Äôm doing.) I.. I do close my eyes. It‚Äôs not because I don‚Äôt like to see what‚Äôs going on, I, in fact, open my Asian small eyes wide while I‚Äôm kissing to see L‚Äôs eyeballs. We are so close so I only get to see his one eye but it‚Äôs rolling half backward, pupil becomes unfocused and dilated(maybe because we drank too), watching a person with the charisma to rule the world, who normally has nothing to be afraid of, become this weak and vulnerable with just a kiss is fascinating and sexy! I got to enjoy it. It‚Äôs more like because I am feeling awkward looking at customers eyes, similar to I can‚Äôt look people eyes directly(EYE CONTACT) when I‚Äôm lying. I‚Äôm shamed and sorrying because I‚Äôm acting(lying) that I‚Äôm enjoying it, and it gets so bored some times so I just close my eyes and think about something else like who the fuck invented tanghulululu etc</p>
<p>What do you do when you think your job is meaningless and boring, no motivational or inspirational in any ways? Also, I‚Äôm in love, üß°UwUüíö I quit. So exciting! I‚Äôll keep on posting here once or twice a week. Thanks for reading byee oh merry christmas!</p>
