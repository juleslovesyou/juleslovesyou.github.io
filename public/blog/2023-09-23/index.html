  <p>Last November, out of boredom and a desire to buy a Rocket Apartmento espresso machine, I booked a room in Rhodes. The guy who was renting the place at that time is an illegal cat breeder. I don‚Äôt know if there are any laws for breeding cats, but anyway, he always had more than 10 cats, and it didn&rsquo;t smell very pleasant. Cats aside, business wasn&rsquo;t that bad, and I wanted to continue working occasionally, but the room was never available again. I know some girls book that place for a week to a month, so a day booking isn&rsquo;t very important for him anyway. Whether I make a thousand dollars a day or a thousand dollars a week, I survive, so no worries. I couldn&rsquo;t buy a Rocket Apartmento but got a Breville for under $500 instead. It does its job, even though it&rsquo;s not as cool as the Rocket Apartmento.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been advertising on E&amp;B for more than a week now, spending an hour or two daily. I&rsquo;ve met 10 guys, and got door-dashed twice üò≠. Seriously though, I acknowledge that I&rsquo;m not everyone&rsquo;s cuppa tea, but what do you expect from my display photos? But anyway, no hard feelings when you leave; it happens. It&rsquo;s still better than no-shows. So, 10 guys minus 2 guys (door-dashed), = 8 guys I actually served, and 4 of them are revisiting guys, so at the end of the day, not bad, huh? My dream one day is to serve only guys with whom I feel comfortable, without advertising, so I can avoid all the time-wasters and free-talkers. I don&rsquo;t mind talking shit, and to be honest, I like it; it&rsquo;s just so much fun. But the majority of too much talkers on the internet are too horny to carry on A conversation. I&rsquo;d have trolled back and forth if it were a few years back, but I can&rsquo;t be bothered anymore. Topics like &ldquo;Sex in the park&rdquo; made me giggle, though, not gonna lie.</p>
<p>Sometimes&hellip; I think a lot of guys have a lot of time on their hands but not much to do in their lives, so they wake up and decide to send weird messages to sex workers. I sincerely hope that they find some hobbies; I have too many, and my day is just too short!</p>
<p>I thought sex work this time could be just some extra money besides my taxable üò≠ income, but once I got cash in my hands, I only went to work for A DAY last week!!! On other days, I shopped, cooked, explored, slept, just bludging around‚Ä¶ I could be a better human.</p>
<p>I may fail again to get a Dyson robot vacuum like the Rocket Apartmento, but it&rsquo;s okay; the V15 still does its job. These are my other wishes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Shelving units (to organize tons of things and grow some hydroponic veggies)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A bed frame (because the current one isn&rsquo;t built for sex work, I feel like)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I want to colour my hair üçä, and visit my parents ahhhhhhhuhuoqshdaosdhoas.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to update on every Sunday. thank you for reading my blog byeee</p>
