  <p>I know many girls charge more for short session than longer ones, for instance, $200 for 30 minutes and $300 for an hour, but I didn&rsquo;t, because, to be honest, a 15 minutes session is just as good as a 60 minutes booking. Come, cum and go in 15 minutes feels like I&rsquo;m doing CrossFit or HIIT yet it can feed me 5 times of banana blossom and 10 times of chatime so how can I not like it.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna lie here, An hour booking is still a priority for me. I only use 15 minutes when I don&rsquo;t feel like full-on working, but I still want ubereats for dinner. I don&rsquo;t want to vacuum, mob, and use my exclusive Aesop incense stick, or having another shower, shaving armpits and blow-dry my hair for just $100, you know.</p>
<p>At this point I got too comfortable with some 15 minutes customers, so I even offered one if he could come everyday for $690($10 off for s3xcription) a week, but I don&rsquo;t think he liked the idea anyway.</p>
<p>The other one, an Indian looking man in his 4-50s who self-claimed to be Fijian(but in other reviews, he&rsquo;s appeared to be of Maori cross or Kiwi breed so who knows what now) has been seeing me I guess a few times by now. I freaked out every time he stood up on my fragile metal frame bed because seriously with his massive 0.1t beer gut, there&rsquo;s no time left for my cheap bed, it&rsquo;s already so weak okay, plus, idk why but my dog never liked him almost like he&rsquo;s the worst enemy so the man even brought a cheap dog treat but you know, I feed my dog only the best even though I eat shinramen-cups. So it did not work. Despite all of those above I still couldn&rsquo;t give up on him because he cums so quick! The actual in and out probably lasts less than 5 minutes, it&rsquo;s&hellip; irresistible. Anyway, right now I&rsquo;m having a mild PTSD while writing this. HE DID NOT PAY $100 the last night and run. I don&rsquo;t think he did this on purpose though, he talks about how good smoking weeds everyday is so I guess he&rsquo;s a bong-head which explains his short-term memory losses.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s partially my fault too, I rushed too much to break my record on how quickly it can be done, so I forgot about $100,00 So who do I blame? Kek but the 15-session will still give me a mild headache, so I won&rsquo;t do it anymore for the sake of my better mental health. You can blame that guy for it if you planned 15s. I wish nothing but the best for him and hope this $100 brings him a lot of joy in his life. However as a warning to other girls, I posted his mugshot on my blog(<a href="https://juleslovesyou.github.io">https://juleslovesyou.github.io</a>), so if you have any sex worker friends, please spread your kindness by showing them his photo.</p>
<p>Okayyy enough for today. thanks for reading byee</p>

$100 was finally paid after 10 days. Consequently, I removed his takoyaki face from the front page because the criminal has sought legal advice and possesses enough evidence to prompt police inquiries into extortion and revenge porn laws. omgg I am so scared &gt;_&lt;</p>
