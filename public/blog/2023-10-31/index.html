  <p>I donâ€™t know if it&rsquo;s cursed laziness engraved in my bone marrow or if it&rsquo;s a blessing that I&rsquo;m not greedy, but either way, it&rsquo;s been a while since I worked or wrote something to grab the attention of the bored and horny guys. Last month, I only worked a few days, and HR wanted to talk to me. I couldn&rsquo;t work more than that, dealing with a million light-speed years of commuting and all, especially when I realized that having a bit of fun with three customers equaled my entire week&rsquo;s hard work. In fact, it&rsquo;s not that hard; it&rsquo;s rather mundane. The perks are pretty good working there, so I don&rsquo;t want to give it up, but at the same time, I asked my colleagues if there&rsquo;s an online resignation form I can just fill out, submit, and disappear like BBQ smoke.</p>
<p>So, did I manage to get a Dyson robot vacuum at last? No. I paid bills and all, and I&rsquo;m still surviving, though not exactly thriving. Instead of the long-forgotten Dyson, I&rsquo;m visiting my parents soon, so please consider contributing to getting gifts for them (I know it sounds a bit entitled). My dad enjoys trekking, so maybe a puffer jacket with some mountain gear from Macpac would be a great idea. My mom loves to socialize, so any luxury goods would work. If you have better souvenir ideas or access to staff discounts, please contact me. We don&rsquo;t always have to have sex, you know. By the way, I don&rsquo;t trust vitamins and minerals in the form of medication!</p>
<p>Whenever friends complain about being single and thus feeling lonely, like crying babies, I laugh and tell them, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re bored, not lonely.&rdquo; But when I see people with a naturally sweet and beaming character, as if they were born with it, my heart races, almost like I&rsquo;m choking myself. I wonder if it&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;m lonely, and my body reacts like a stray cat.. .</p>
<p>I have some history of being bombarded by love-bombing (from their perspective, it&rsquo;s just kindness, I guess) and misunderstanding their intentions, throwing tantrums like, &ldquo;I thought you liked me, boo hoo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maybe&hellip; It&rsquo;s just jealousy because I wasn&rsquo;t born with a enticing personality or appearance, otherwise a great social skills. I may be extremely envious of those who seem to have it all, until my heart sinks and I confuse myself, wondering, &ldquo;Wtf is this feeling? Kek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Real loneliness hit me so so hard when I couldn&rsquo;t open a pickle jar the other night. I felt powerless, worthless piece of female shit who always needs a man&rsquo;s help. I tried many online methods to open the jar, including placing it upside down in a bowl of hot water, but it just wouldn&rsquo;t budge. In the end, I broke the jar with a hammer and transfer it to another food container. It was pure violence and anger, no loneliness anymore when I look back.</p>
<p>You see, you should do this too. Keep denying your true feelings and chant instead, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not lonely! I&rsquo;m just horny, bored, jealous, angry, and fearful!&rdquo; It&rsquo;s easier this way, trust me.</p>
<p>I can talk like this for hours and often engage in conversations with my customers about the most random things, for hours, days, and, occasionally, years at this point. I&rsquo;m a good listener, open to any subject, and not afraid of new ideas, so please book me and help the proletariat.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading, byeeee!</p>
